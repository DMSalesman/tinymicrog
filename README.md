This module installs microG's Services Core, Services Framework Proxy, FakeStore, and DroidGuard Helper as system apps, systemlessly.

-----

## Before installing

Make sure your ROM supports signature spoofing. If not, use [Haystack](https://github.com/Lanchon/haystack) and [mksigspoofmod](https://github.com/DMSalesman/mksigspoofmod) from your computer or [NanoDroid-patcher](https://downloads.nanolx.org/NanoDroid/Stable/) from Android, which comes with automatic repatching on OTA update.

This module **will not** patch your ROM.
